[Topic modelling of fraud prevention policies](./topicmodelling.html) <br>
For my master thesis, I examined a larger number of documents regarding fraud prevention using topic modelling. It showcases my ability to code in Python, use Natural Language Processing, and data visualisation using both Python and Tableau.
Skills showcased
- Python programming, including use of Gensim, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn
- Machine learning using Natural Language Processing
- Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
- Data wrangling and transformation
- Visualisations using Tableau 

[Fraud Database](./SQL_project.md) <br>
I created a database based on a dataset with fraudulent transactions. I then manipulated the data with SQL queries.
Skills showcased
- Database Design and Schema Creation
- Data import, cleaning, and transformation.
. Writing and optimizing complex SQL queries, including joins, aggregations, CTE, window functions, and UNIONs.

[Fraud prediction](./supervisedml.html) <br>
In this project, I explored a dataset with transactions and used machine learning to find out which factors are the most important for preicting fraud.
Skills showcased
- Feature engineering
- Python programming, including use of Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn
- Supervised machine learning model building
- Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
- Statistical analysis
- Visualisations using Tableau

[Indicators of fraud dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/supervisedexploration/Instrumentpanel7?:language=sv-SE&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:device=desktop) <br>
This is a Tableau dashboard based on the fraud dataset from the Fraud prediction project, showing the most important insights from the dataset.
Skills showcased
- Visualisations using Tableau
- Calculated fields in Tableau
- KPI:s for fraud
