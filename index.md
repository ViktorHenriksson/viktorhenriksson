[Topic modelling of fraud prevention policies](./topicmodelling.html) <br>
For my master thesis, I examined a larger number of documents regarding fraud prevention using topic modelling. It showcases my ability to code in Python, use Natural Language Processing, and data visualisation using both Python and Tableau.
Skills showcased
- Python programming, including use of Gensim, Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn
- Machine learning using Natural Language Processing
- Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
- Data wrangling and transformation
- Visualisations using Tableau 

[Fraud Database](./SQL_project.md) <br>
Skills showcased
- Database Design and Schema Creation
- Data import, cleaning, and transformation.
. Writing and optimizing complex SQL queries, including joins, aggregations, CTE, window functions, and UNIONs.
